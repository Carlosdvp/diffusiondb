# DiffusionDB
## Summary

DiffusionDB is a large-scale image generation prompt dataset. Each image in DiffusionDB is generated using the deep learning, text-to-image model known as Stable Diffusion, which was released by StabilityAI in 2022. The dataset maps the textual prompt inputs to the images generated by the Stable Diffusion model. The goal of this dataset is to enable researchers to explore how people write prompts and help design better tooling for prompt engineering. DiffusionDB contains xxx text-to-image mappings which were mined from the Stable Diffusion discord server (https://discord.gg/stablediffusion).

## Source Data

### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Initial data for DiffusionDB image generation prompt dataset consists of images collected from the Stable Diffusion public discord server. The textual prompts which were input into the Stable Diffusion model to generate the images are retrieved from the image file metadata and mapped to the associated image that was generated. These images were filtered for quality control by human annotators.

### Who are the source language producers?

The images and prompts are retrieved from the Stable Diffusion public discord server.

## Annotations

### Annotation process

The annotation process of collecting DiffusionDB images and prompts is a three step process:

Mining images generated from the Stable Diffusion model from the Stable Diffusion discord server.
Collecting the candidate image prompt that was used to generate the image from the image file metadata.
Quality control on the candidate images and prompts by human annotators.

### Who are the annotators?

Images are mined from a Stable Diffusion discord server and filtered by human annotators.

## Personal and Sensitive Information

Potential personal information
We provide ways to let users remove prompt and image from our dataset

This dataset does not contain the images of people without their consent.

## Other Known Limitations

One limitation of DiffusionDB is the possible inclusion of harmful images and prompts. We collect images and their prompts
from the Stable Diffusion discord server. Even though the discord server has rules against users sharing any NSFW (not suitable for work,
such as sexual and violent content) and illegal images, it is possible that some discord users had posted harmful images that were not removed
by the server moderators. Therefore, DiffusionDB can potentially contain these images. To mitigate the potential harm, we provide a Google Form where users can report inappropriate images or prompts:
