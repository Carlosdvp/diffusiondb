# Summary

DiffusionDB is a large-scale image generation prompt dataset. Each image in DiffusionDB is generated using the deep learning, text-to-image model known as Stable Diffusion, which was released by StabilityAI in 2022. The dataset maps the textual prompt inputs to the images generated by the Stable Diffusion model. The goal of this dataset is to enable researchers to explore how people write prompts and help design better tooling for prompt engineering. DiffusionDB contains xxx text-to-image mappings which were mined from the Stable Diffusion discord server (https://discord.gg/stablediffusion).

# Dataset Creation

## Curation Rationale

[TODO]
There did not yet exist a dataset with a large number of Stable Diffusion prompts and images, and we believed that the creation of a dataset would be of use to researchers. Many images online do not have the necessary data to construct such a dataset, but the Dream channels of the Public Diffusion discord server would always include the prompts in a message alongside the image itself. 

We believed that 
Public discord server
Many images there

## Source Data
The source data was the Dream Channels 21-50 from the Stable Diffusion discord server. 

### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Initial data for DiffusionDB image generation prompt dataset consists of images collected from the Stable Diffusion public discord server. These images were collected using the Discord Chat Exporter made by GitHub user Tyrrrz, which may be found here: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter. The textual prompts which were input into the Stable Diffusion model to generate the images are retrieved from the image file metadata and mapped to the associated image that was generated. These images were filtered for quality control by human annotators. For some messages sent, there existed multipled images generated by a single prompt joined together in a singular file. In this instance, one of these four images was randomly selected and the rest were not included in the dataset.

### Who are the source language producers?

The images and prompts are retrieved from the Stable Diffusion public discord server.

## Annotations

### Annotation process

The annotation process of collecting DiffusionDB images and prompts is a three step process:

Mining images generated from the Stable Diffusion model from the Stable Diffusion discord server.
Collecting the candidate image prompt that was used to generate the image from the image file metadata.
Quality control on the candidate images and prompts by human annotators.

### Who are the annotators?

Images are mined from a Stable Diffusion discord server and filtered by human annotators.

## Personal and Sensitive Information

Potential personal information
We provide ways to let users remove prompt and image from our dataset

This dataset does not contain the images of people without their consent.
